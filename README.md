Unique launcher with simple interface that can allow you to read news, launch your app easily.

I've been a fan of blinkfeed since I started using my M7 until today with the beast M8.  But I also love AOSP rom especially the new Lollipop. I can't resist to use it but after a week I started to miss news on my homescreen. So I began my development for this application over the weekend and here it is. It is still in alpha stage in which still have few bugs. But I think its not major so I just release it to share with you guys. Its different from other launcher. Trust me, you can try it. I'm using SDK for Lollipop because I like the material design. This is just 2 days of work so not much can be done perfectly. Expect more features soon....
